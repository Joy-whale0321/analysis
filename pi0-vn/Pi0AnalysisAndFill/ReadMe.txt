This folder holds codes created for filling the invariant mass histograms, analysis of cuts, and analysis of invariant mass distributions.

CutPlottingMacros contains the macros used to plot the cut distributions
---CutAnalysisPlots is what is outputted on these cut distributions from this folder

Macros11-16 is what macros were used at the time of Bulk TG presentation on 11/14 including:
--filling histogram macro
---plotting mass macro, that contains the fitting procedure, S/B calculation, and yield text file filling
Invariant_Mass_Plots contains the 11 indices of the bins used for invariant mass distributions, as well as the signalYield output, and signalError outptu used to generate pi0 signal yield output and pi0 relative signal error
